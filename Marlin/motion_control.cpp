  /* Vector rotation by transformation matrix: r is the original vector, r_T is the rotated vector,
     and phi is the angle of rotation. Based on the solution approach by Jens Geisler.
         r_T = [cos(phi) -sin(phi);
                sin(phi)  cos(phi] * r ;
     
     For arc generation, the center of the circle is the axis of rotation and the radius vector is 
     defined from the circle center to the initial position. Each line segment is formed by successive
     vector rotations. This requires only two cos() and sin() computations to form the rotation
     matrix for the duration of the entire arc. Error may accumulate from numerical round-off, since
     all double numbers are single precision on the Arduino. (True double precision will not have
     round off issues for CNC applications.) Single precision error can accumulate to be greater than
     tool precision in some cases. Therefore, arc path correction is implemented. 

     Small angle approximation may be used to reduce computation overhead further. This approximation
     holds for everything, but very small circles and large mm_per_arc_segment values. In other words,
     theta_per_segment would need to be greater than 0.1 rad and N_ARC_CORRECTION would need to be large
     to cause an appreciable drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION~=25 is more than small enough to correct for 
     numerical drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION may be on the order a hundred(s) before error becomes an
     issue for CNC machines with the single precision Arduino calculations.
     
     This approximation also allows mc_arc to immediately insert a line segment into the planner 
     without the initial overhead of computing cos() or sin(). By the time the arc needs to be applied
     a correction, the planner should have caught up to the lag caused by the initial mc_arc overhead. 
     This is important when there are successive arc motions.

/* The algorithm for computing the step is loosely based on the one in
   Kig (see
   https://sources.debian.net/src/kig/4:15.08.3-1/misc/kigpainter.cpp/#L759);
   however, we do not use the stack.

   The algorithm goes as it follows: the parameters t runs from 0.0 to
   1.0 describing the curve, which is evaluated by eval_bezier(). At
   each iteration we have to choose a step, i.e., the increment of the
   t variable. By default the step of the previous iteration is taken,
   and then it is enlarged or reduced depending on how straight the
   curve locally is. The step is always clamped between MIN_STEP/2 and
   2*MAX_STEP. MAX_STEP is taken at the first iteration.

   For some t, the step value is considered acceptable if the curve in
   the interval [t, t+step] is sufficiently straight, i.e.,
   sufficiently close to linear interpolation. In practice the
   following test is performed: the distance between eval_bezier(...,
   t+step/2) is evaluated and compared with 0.5*(eval_bezier(...,
   t)+eval_bezier(..., t+step)). If it is smaller than SIGMA, then the
   step value is considered acceptable, otherwise it is not. The code
   seeks to find the larger step value which is considered acceptable.

   At every iteration the recorded step value is considered and then
   iteratively halved until it becomes acceptable. If it was already
   acceptable in the beginning (i.e., no halving were done), then
   maybe it was necessary to enlarge it; then it is iteratively
   doubled while it remains acceptable. The last acceptable value
   found is taken, provided that it is between MIN_STEP and MAX_STEP
   and does not bring t over 1.0.

   Caveat: this algorithm is not perfect, since it can happen that a
   step is considered acceptable even when the curve is not linear at
   all in the interval [t, t+step] (but its mid point coincides "by
   chance" with the midpoint according to the parametrization). This
   kind of glitches can be eliminated with proper first derivative
   estimates; however, given the improbability of such configurations,
   the mitigation offered by MIN_STEP and the small computational
   power available on Arduino, I think it is not wise to implement it.
